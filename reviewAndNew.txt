	translation
	rotation
	coordination transform

coordination transform
	cos(a + b) = cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b)
	sin(a + b) = sin(a)cos(b) + cos(a)sin(b)

	x, -y
	y, x

	u = (x, y)
	v = (-y, x)

rotation
	2d rotation pivot is origin point
	3d axis rotation transform 3d rotation into 2d rotation by removing rotation axis
