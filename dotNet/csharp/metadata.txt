Common language runtime(CLR)
    A CLR handles memory allocation and management.
    A CLR is also a virtual machine that not only executes apps but also 
        generates and compiles code on-the-fly using a JIT compiler.

MSIL(Microsoft intermedia language) instructions
    with metadata tokens

Metadata
    tables
        holds information about the element of your program(classes, methods, fields and so on)
        row collections
        reference heap data
    heaps(string, blob, user string, GUID)
        similar to heap memory, storage actual information and can be referenced. 
Metadata tokens
    4 bytes number. The first byte denotes a metadata table, and the remaining 
        three bytes specify the row in the metadata table.
    
PE(portable executable) file
    PE header
        index
        entry point
    MSIL instructions 
    Metadata

Run-Time use of Metadata
    A CLR converts MSIL into native machine instructions using JIT compiler at a time
        as need. If a metadata tokens is encountered, then retrieve address and process
        new address.
