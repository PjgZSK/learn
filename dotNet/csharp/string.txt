    raw \string"""
    output: 
    this "is a"
    raw \string

Format strings
    A format string is a string whose contexts are determined dynamically at run time.
    Format strings are created by embedding interpolated expressions or placeholders inside 
        of braces within a string.
    Everything inside braces({...}) is resolved to a value and output as a formatted string
        at run time.

String interpolation
    Interpolated string are identified by the $ special character and include interpolated
        expressions inside braces.
    
    var jh = (firstName: "Jupiter", lastName: "Hammon", born: 1711, published: 1761);
    $"{jh.firstName} {jh.lastName} was an African American poet born in {jh.born}." 
    output: Jupiter Hammon was an African American poet born in 1711.
    
    raw string literals
    $$"""{{jh.firstName}} {{jh.lastName}} was an African American poet born in {{jh.born}}."""
    output: Jupiter Hammon was an African American poet born in 1711.
    
    verbatim string literals
    $@"{jh.firstName} {jh.lastName} was an African American poet born in {jh.born}." 
    @$"{jh.firstName} {jh.lastName} was an African American poet born in {jh.born}." 
    output: Jupiter Hammon was an African American poet born in 1711.

Composite formatting
    var jh = (firstName: "Jupiter", lastName: "Hammon", born: 1711, published: 1761);
    string.Format("{0} {1} was an African American poet born in {2}.", jh.firstName, jh.lastName, jh.born); 
    output: Jupiter Hammon was an African American poet born in 1711.
