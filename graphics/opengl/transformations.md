# Transformations
## 1.1 
- We can make objects move by changing their vertices and re-configuring their buffers  
each frame, but this is cumbersome and cost a lot.  
    - line one
    - line two
- There are much better ways to transform an object and that's by using (multiple) matrix  
objects.  
## Vectors
1. A vector has a direction and a magnitude.  
2. Vector mathematician description:  
$$\vec a = 
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{pmatrix}$$
And their origin position is usually zero.
